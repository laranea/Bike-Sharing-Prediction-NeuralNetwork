# Bike-Sharing-Prediction-Neural-Network
 Building a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a Bike Sharing dataset! 
 
 Developed as coursework for Udacity "Deep Learning" Nanodegree. In this project, I built a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership.
 
## Implementation Of:
   1.Forwardpropogation
   2.Backpropagation
   3.Gradient Descent
   4.Neural Networks
   5.Numpy
   6.Pandas
 
Thank You!
